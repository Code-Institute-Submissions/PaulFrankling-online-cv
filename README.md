The website uses the font of *Quicksand* and the font of *Open-sans* is used as backup font in case of any difficulty to present the primary font of *Quicksand*.

### Imagery

In the **Profile section**, I have used a professionally presented image to suit the purpose of the website, which is providing a good impression to an employer or potential colleague.

### Wireframes

* **Profile section** (Including header) wireframe - ![profile](assets/wireframes/profile-wireframe.png)
* **History section** wireframe - ![history](assets/wireframes/history-wireframe.png)
* **Interests section** wireframe - ![interests](assets/wireframes/interests-wireframe.png)
* **Contact section** (Including footer) wireframe - ![contact](assets/wireframes/contact-wireframe.png)

## Features:

* Interactive elements.
* Responsive on all device screen sizes.

## Features to implement in the future:

* I want to apply a portfolio section to my website to display future projects. I have stated this in my **Profile Section**:
> "Whilst studying for a Diploma, I will be establishing a portfolio section to present all my created projects."
* I want to apply a modal to my contact-form that will give the viewer a submission confirmation message when they have completed and submitted the form.
