# Paul Frankling | Online CV

## Code Institute - Milestone Project 1

[Click here to view my website](https://paulfrankling.github.io/PaulFrankling-online-cv/)

This website has been designed to represent a professional overview of myself to a target audience of prospective employers, recruiters or web developers. The primary goal of the website is to make a memorable impression on this target audience and for them to communicate with me using the contact page.

This website may also interest anyone looking to create a CV or Online CV and look for ideas. Friends and Family may also like to view my project.


## UX:

  * ### User Stories

    * #### First Time Visitor Goals
      * As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand the purpose of the webpage and learn more about the person through their Online CV.
      * As a First Time Visitor, I want to navigate easily around the website to find content.
      * As a First Time Visitor, I want to locate social media links to further legitamise the profile and allow the employer to see the client in a different capacity.

    * #### Returning Visitor Goals
      * As a Returning Visitor, I would like to contact the person with any queries or propositions.
      * As a Returning Visitor, I would like to be able to view and/or download the persons CV that is available on the website.

    * #### Frequent User Goals
      * As a Frequent User, I would like to be able to connect with the person on their social media accounts.
      * As a Frequent User, I would like to see of any updates to their CV or website.

## Design:

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of the webpage is:
* Space Cadet `#2d3142`
* Independence `#4f5d75`
* Silver `#bfc0c0`
* Mandarin `#ef8354`
* White `#fff`

### Typography

The website uses the font of *Quicksand* and the font of *Open-sans* is used as backup font in case of any difficulty to present the primary font of *Quicksand*.

### Imagery

In the **Profile section**, I have used a professionally presented image to suit the purpose of the website, which is providing a good impression to an employer or potential colleague.

### Wireframes

* **Profile section** (Including Header) wireframe - ![profile](assets/wireframes/profile-wireframe.png)
* **History section** wireframe - ![history](assets/wireframes/history-wireframe.png)
* **Interests section** wireframe - ![interests](assets/wireframes/interests-wireframe.png)
* **Contact section** (Including Footer) wireframe - ![contact](assets/wireframes/contact-wireframe.png)

## Features:

The website has a responsive navigation bar in the header and I have added `scroll-behavior: smooth;` to the navigation to keep the user oriented by scrolling to its destination. It looks better than the navigation instantly taking the user to its website destination.
The navigation bar also features a change of colour to madarin `#ef8354` when the user hovers over each link which has been done to enhance interactivity.

The Footer has copyright information as well as social media icons and a download icon for my CV. Again, I have implemented a change of colour to mandarin `#ef8354` when these icons are hovered over.

### Profile Section

My profile section is split into two parts; a summary of my profile and a list of personal details. They are seperated into two columns when viewed on a tablet and desktop. My profile explains my present status and future aims and aspirations. I present this by displaying a question in bold and an answer next to each one.

My personal details are briefly presented with an image of myself. This image provides a professional perception to the user. I include one of two CV download icons here too. 



## Features to implement in the future:

* I want to apply a portfolio section to my website to display future projects, I have stated this in my **Profile Section**;

> "Whilst studying for my Diploma, I will be establishing a portfolio section to present all my created projects."

* I want to apply a modal to my contact-form that will give the viewer a submission confirmation message when they have completed and submitted the form.
