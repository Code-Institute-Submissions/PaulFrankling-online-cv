# First Milestone Project - My Portfolio

I designed this project with the ambition of creating a user friendly website. Whilst I wanted to present something unique, making the website
easy to navigate around was key to the formation of the site. My target audience would predominantly be future employees or other web developers and I wanted to make a big impression by designing something clear and concise.

## User Experience

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of the webpage is Space Cadet, Independence, Silver, White and Mandarin.

### Typography

The website uses the font of *Quicksand* and the font of *Open-sans* is used as backup font in case of any difficulty to present the primary font of *Quicksand*.

### Imagery

In the **Profile section**, I have used a professionally presented image to suit the purpose of the website, which is providing a good impression to an employer or potential colleague.
